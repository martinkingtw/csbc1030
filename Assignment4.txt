# Assignment 4 -- Express JS Basics

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to setup a basic ExpressJS application, that allows a user to fetch a list of users and a specific user that are stored on the server.

## Starting Point

The following Assignments build on top of each other, and should be completed in order.

## Instructions

Create a new branch for this assignment, branching from the main branch.

Create an ExpressJS application that reads a list of users from a file and exposes two routes:

1. GET `/users` that returns all users
2. GET `/users/:id` that returns a user with a specific id

use the users.json from the samples folder for a list of users and their structure.

## Submission

Create a PR from your assignment branch to the main branch of your repository.

The PR should include all necessary files + a README for instructions on how to run the assignment.

Submit a link to that PR and the commit ID in the assignment submission box.

### Assignment Continuity Note

If you are unable to finish an assignment and need sample code for the next assignment please reach out to me, and we will discuss the situation.
